I am a third year Ph.D student of Information Science at School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University Bloomington. My advisor is Dr. [Xiaozhong Liu](http://scholarwiki.indiana.edu/homepage/index.html). I am interested in information retrieval, data mining, machine learning and complex network. Currently, I am trying to solve personalized community detection and real time recommendation tasks on scholarly data and social media data, which is related to both text mining and graph mining.
